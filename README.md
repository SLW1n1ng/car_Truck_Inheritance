# car_Truck_Inheritance
# Vehicle Class Project using Inheritance in C++

This project demonstrates the use of a vehicle class hierarchy in C++. 
The program defines a base class called `Vehicle`, and two derived classes, 
`Car` and `Truck`, which inherit from the base class.

The `Vehicle` class provides basic functionalities and attributes common to all vehicles, 
such as color, make, model, year, and speed. The derived classes, `Car` and `Truck`, 
inherit these attributes and provide their own specific implementations for certain behaviors,
such as sounding the horn, starting, stopping, accelerating, and decelerating.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository or download the source code files.
3. Compile the source code files using your C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable.

## File Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `car.h` and `car.cpp`: Define the `Car` class and its member functions.
- `truck.h` and `truck.cpp`: Define the `Truck` class and its member functions.
- `vehicle.h` and `vehicle.cpp`: Define the `Vehicle` base class and its member functions.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the `main()` function where the program execution begins.

## Usage

Upon running the program, two vehicles, a `Car` and a `Truck`, are instantiated with 
their respective attributes. The program then demonstrates various operations on these
vehicles, such as sounding the horn, starting, stopping, accelerating, and decelerating.

The output of the program will be displayed in the console, showing the actions performed 
on each vehicle and their respective results.

## Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the attributes of the `Car` and `Truck`
objects created in the `main()` function of the `main.cpp` file. You can change the color,
make, model, and year of the vehicles, as well as add or modify their behaviors by editing
the member functions in the respective classes.
